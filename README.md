# ðŸ“˜ Java College Assignments

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises developed during my college studies in **Systems Analysis and Development**. Each file demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and object-oriented thinking in Java.

## ðŸ“‚ Exercise List

### 01. `01_trip_fuel_calculator.java`
**Description:**  
Calculates the total distance of a trip based on time and average speed, then estimates the amount of fuel needed assuming a consumption rate of 12 km/L.

---

### 02. `02_celsius_to_fahrenheit.java`
**Description:**  
Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard formula. Input and output are handled via console.

---

### 03. `03_absolute_value.java`
**Description:**  
Calculates the absolute value of an integer without using built-in functions. Demonstrates use of conditional logic.

---

### 04. `04_number_to_word.java`
**Description:**  
Receives an integer input (1 to 3) and returns its equivalent in Portuguese text. Uses `switch-case` control structure and includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.

---

### 05. `05_triangle_type_checker.java`
**Description:**  
Given the lengths of three sides, this program checks whether they form a valid triangle and classifies it as **equilateral**, **isosceles**, or **scalene**.

---

### 06. `06_number_sign_checker_menu.java`
**Description:**  
Allows the user to check if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**, using a menu-driven loop until the user chooses to exit.

---

### 07. `07_countdown_from_200.java`
**Description:**  
Prints all integers from 200 down to 1 using a `for` loop.

---

### 08. `08_odd_numbers_100_to_200.java`
**Description:**  
Displays all odd numbers between 200 and 100 in descending order.

---

### 09. `09_even_odd_sum_list.java`
**Description:**  
Reads a list of non-negative integers (stopping at the first negative input), prints the list, and shows the sum of even and odd numbers separately.

---

### 10. `10_reverse_sequence.java`
**Description:**  
Reads a sequence of integers into an array and prints them in reverse order.

---

### 11. `11_dot_product_vectors.java`
**Description:**  
Reads two integer arrays of equal length and calculates their **dot product** (scalar product).

---

### 12. `12_compare_elements_to_x.java`
**Description:**  
Reads an array of 10 integers and compares each element to a target value `X`, reporting how many are **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** `X`.
